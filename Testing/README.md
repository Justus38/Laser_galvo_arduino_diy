there were many steps involved in getting the galvo to run. first we have to know the interface which the laser uses. the ilda interface in this case it needs one analog input from -10v to +10v for every galvo motor. I used two in this case so the connector for controlling has 3 pins: x input, gnd, y input. now to generating this signals there are many ways of doing that but I opted for a 0-4.096v dac(mcp4822) for the initial variable output voltage. there are also unipolar dacs which can create +-5 or +-10v but these are mostly very expensive or hard to get for someone like me. because of that I used the mcp4822 i created a subtraction circuit using an Opamp(tl082). I supply one channel from the dac as the voltage which gets subtracted and one for the subtraction reference. in this case I have 0-4 so I subtraction 2v from the dac output a to get +-2 volts. this is already nice now I just need to amplify that to +-10v using the other op amp of the tl082 i create a amplifying circuit with a gain of 5 now I get +10v when I set the dac voltage to 4v and -10v when setting it to 0v
